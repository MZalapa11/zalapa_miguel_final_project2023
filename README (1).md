# Fall2023_final_project

For my project I plan to make a game like Agar.io I loved that game as a kid so I plan to recreate it here.

## Description

I found a youtube series that I will be using to guide me throughout the process. I won't just make a simple agar.io I will add my own things onto it and I plan to add weapons like a sword.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

I have downloaded pygame and created a reposetory in github.

### Installing

For a modification to my file I had to stop hiding folders that .git could appear

### Executing program

* Press play button and control player (the big cirle) eat little squares and every time you eat it you get bigger. There are enemies which are mobs and they try killing you by running into you.
* Step-by-step bullets
```
